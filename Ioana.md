Ioana Petan progress chess project chess_and_the_city

Week 1: Input/Output Functionality:

•	Worked on reading the input history file to determine the color assigned to the AI chess bot.

•	Implemented the functionality for outputting a move in the correct format to an output file.

•	Developed the first version of the main.cpp file.

•	Files worked on: reading.h, reading.cpp.

Week 2: Board and Display Implementation:

•	Collaborated with Carla Guinea and Gretl Baghdadi to implement the chessboard and display.

•	Set up white and black pieces, board characteristics, and developed functions to handle piece movement and color assignments.

•	Files worked on: chess_board.cpp, chess_board.h.

Week 3:Castling Development:

•	Implemented castling.cpp along with Gretl.

•	Adjusted logic for castling and ensured that key constraints were addressed.

Week 4: Output Handling:

•	Ensured moves were correctly output in the specified format.

Week 5: Castling and Promotion:

•	Worked alongside Gretl Baghdadi on the castling function and Ritthigaa Anabayan on the promotion function.

•	Incorporated castling and promotion into core files (chess_board.cpp, piece.cpp) for integration with the AI algorithm.

•	Recognized and handled promotions by the opponent and castling events in gameplay.

•	Files worked on: castling.cpp, promotion.cpp.

Week 6-7: Algorithm Development:

•	Collaborated with Carla Guinea and Agatha Beffy to create and refine the chess AI algorithm.

•	Developed the first version of the algorithm, which was later enhanced and corrected by the team.

•	Key contributions included implementing the minmax function, find_best_move, and generate_all_pieces.

Code Refinement and Debugging:

•	Fixed small errors across files.

•	Made final adjustments to the castling logic.
