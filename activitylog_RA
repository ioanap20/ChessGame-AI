>>week comm. Dec 2
working on implementing an update_board function with Ioana in reading.cpp
finished my code and pushed to Ioana for her to check and modify


>>week comm. Dec 9
designated to code promotion for the chess engine (solo working)
asking for help on how to pull contents of main branch into my personal branch with TA
coding is_promotion_valid() function


>>week comm. Dec 16
coding is_promotion_valid() function
working on code structure for do_promotion() function
chat with agatha who advised to use maps to make code more efficient
agatha walks me through logic of the code using maps
also talking through checking to see if enemy team has carried out a promotion in the reading file


>>week comm. Dec 30
researching how maps work in c++
rethinking the code structure for promotion using maps instead
writing down method via comments to refer to next time


>>week comm. Jan 6
working out how to merge my promotion files to the main branch
manually uploading my promotion files to main after renaming existing file names to make it clearer
struggling with starting the code because I didn't understand the syntax and variable names already used by others in other files.
deciphered other files such as chessboard.h/.cpp ; piece.cpp and castling.cpp to learn from other's code, code structure and be up to date with their variable names.
helped Carla who helped me code the reading promotion in the reading.cpp file during the TD 09/01/25
studied previous lecture slides and asked chatgpt to help explain certain concepts to recode promotion.

>>week comm. Jan 13
promotion with syntactic help from Ioana
